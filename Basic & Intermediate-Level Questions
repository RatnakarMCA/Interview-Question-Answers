#### 1Q. What are your day-to-day activities as a DevOps/Kubernetes engineer?
Answer:

In my day to day activities , I will handle multiple tasks:
My day starts with a team meeting called a "scrum call." 
In this meeting, we discuss our progress, and the team assigns tasks for the day.
After the meeting, I check Jenkins, a tool we use for automation. 
I look for any new builds or updates. If there are errors in the builds, I work on fixing them.
Kubernetes Monitoring: If Jenkins is running smoothly, 
I move on to checking our Kubernetes (K8s) clusters and pods. 
These are parts of our system where applications run. 
If any pod has issues or isn’t working correctly, 
I troubleshoot the problem, fix it, and inform my team about the updates.
Sometimes, I create Kubernetes configuration files called manifest files. 
These define how our applications and services should run in the Kubernetes environment.
We have distributed team,where cloud team will ping me,for some cloud tasks like 
creating ebs,s3,iam roles and vpc related issues.

#### 2Q. Any issues in your project?
Answer:

High CPU/memory usage in some pods.
Disk space issues in nodes.
Stuck pods due to PVC binding problems.
API server latency under high load.
Ingress routing misconfigurations.

#### 10Q. What happens if the kubelet goes down?
Answer:
If the kubelet on a node goes down:
The node stops reporting to the Kubernetes control plane.
After a default period (usually 5 minutes), the node is marked NotReady.
The scheduler may reschedule the pods on other healthy nodes (if they are not static pods or daemonsets).

#### 11Q. What is a static pod in Kubernetes?
Answer:
A static pod is managed directly by the kubelet on a node, not through the Kubernetes API server.
Defined in a local manifest file (e.g., /etc/kubernetes/manifests/).
Used for critical components like control plane pods.
Cannot be managed with kubectl.

#### 12Q. What is the role of the Kubernetes scheduler?
Answer:
The Kubernetes scheduler assigns newly created pods to nodes based on:
Resource availability
Node affinity/anti-affinity
Taints and tolerations
Custom scheduling rules

#### 13Q. Can the scheduler schedule the API server as well?
Answer:
No, the API server and other control plane components are usually run as static pods, which are not scheduled by the Kubernetes scheduler.

#### 14Q. Compare Deployment vs. StatefulSet
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| **Feature**           | **Deployment**                                  | **StatefulSet**                                |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Use Case**          | Stateless applications (e.g., web servers)      | Stateful applications (e.g., databases)        |
| **Pod Identity**      | Pods are **interchangeable**, no fixed identity | Each Pod has a **stable, unique identity**     |
| **Pod Name**          | Random suffix (e.g., `nginx-xyz12`)             | Predictable names (e.g., `db-0`, `db-1`)       |
| **Storage (Volumes)** | Shared or ephemeral                             | Each Pod gets its **own persistent volume**    |
| **Scaling**           | Easy and fast; Pods treated equally             | Slower, one Pod updated at a time              |
| **Network Identity**  | No stable DNS for individual Pods               | Each Pod gets a **stable DNS hostname**        |
| **Pod Ordering**      | No guaranteed order for startup/termination     | Follows **ordered deployment and termination** |
| **Use With**          | Frontend apps, APIs, microservices              | Databases (e.g., MySQL, Cassandra, Kafka)      |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| **Aspect**            | **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)**               | **VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler)**                        |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scaling Direction** | **Horizontal** – scales the number of Pods        | **Vertical** – adjusts CPU/Memory of a single Pod        |
| **Purpose**           | Handle increased load by adding/removing Pods     | Optimize resource usage within Pods                      |
| **Metrics Used**      | CPU, memory,or custom metrics (via Metrics Server)| Historical usage and live metrics                        |
| **Pod Restart**       | No restart (new Pods added/removed)               | **Pod restart required** to apply new resource values    |
| **Best Use Case**     | Stateless apps with variable load(e.g,web servers)| Long-running apps with consistent load patterns          |
| **Kubernetes Object** | `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` resource                | `VerticalPodAutoscaler` resource                         |
| **Limitations**       | Can’t optimize within a Pod                       | Not suitable for rapid load spikes or multi-replica apps |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 158Q. How do you execute commands in Linux?
Answer:
•	Directly in shell: ls, echo, cd
•	Or in script files with .sh extension
•	Use bash script.sh or ./script.sh

#### 159Q. In which environments do you work?
Answer:
•	Dev – Development
•	QA – Testing
•	UAT – User Acceptance Testing
•	Prod – Live/production

#### 160Q. How can you recover a deleted S3 object?
Q: How do you restore a deleted S3 object?
A: If versioning was enabled, I can retrieve the deleted object using a previous version. Without versioning, the object is permanently deleted unless S3 backup (e.g., replication or lifecycle rule to Glacier) is configured.

#### 161Q. How do you differentiate between a public and a private subnet in AWS?
Q: How do you identify a public vs private subnet?
A: A public subnet has a route to the internet via an internet gateway (IGW). A private subnet lacks this route and usually uses a NAT gateway for internet access. I verify this by checking route tables.

#### 162Q. How to recreate infrastructure in Terraform?
Q: How do you recreate Terraform-managed resources?
A: I use terraform taint <resource> to mark a resource for recreation, or terraform destroy followed by terraform apply to recreate everything. I also use terraform state rm if needed to remove a resource from state before recreating.

#### 163Q. What is a remote module in Terraform?
Q: What is a remote Terraform module and how do you use it?
A: A remote module is a reusable configuration hosted in a repo (like GitHub, Terraform Registry). It’s used via a module block with a source URL. 

Example:

module "vpc" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "3.0.0"
  ...
}

#### 164Q. What are modules in Terraform?
Q: Why do you use modules in Terraform?
A: Modules group and reuse Terraform configurations, promoting clean and DRY code. They help manage large infrastructure by encapsulating resources like VPCs, EC2s, or databases into logical components.

#### 165Q. How can you pass passwords securely in Terraform?
Q: How do you handle sensitive values like passwords in Terraform?
A: I use terraform.tfvars or environment variables and mark them as sensitive in the variable block. For storage, I use tools like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault and access them using data blocks.

#### 166Q. What is the difference between CMD and ARG in a Dockerfile?
Q: What’s the difference between CMD and ARG in Docker?
A: ARG defines variables at build-time, while CMD provides defaults for runtime. 

Example:

dockerfile

ARG VERSION=1.0
CMD ["node", "app.js"]

#### 167Q. How do you secure Docker images?
Q: What steps do you take to secure Docker images?
A: I use minimal base images (like Alpine), scan images with tools like Trivy or Docker Scout, avoid hardcoding secrets, use .dockerignore, and sign images using Docker Content Trust or Notary.

#### 168Q. How do you secure a 3-tier architecture?
Q: How do you secure a 3-tier app (web, app, DB)?
A: I use security groups and NACLs to isolate layers:
•	Web tier: Public subnet with limited inbound (HTTP/HTTPS).
•	App tier: Private subnet, allows traffic only from web tier.
•	DB tier: Private subnet, accessible only by app tier.
Enable encryption (TLS, KMS), IAM roles, and monitoring (CloudWatch, GuardDuty).

#### 169Q. How do you expose your app to the internet in Kubernetes?
Q: How do you expose an application in Kubernetes to the internet?
A: I use a Service of type LoadBalancer or Ingress. For complex routing and HTTPS, I prefer using an Ingress controller (like NGINX or ALB Ingress).

#### 170Q. How do you connect Jenkins to the cloud (AWS)?
Q: How do you connect Jenkins to cloud environments like AWS?
A: I configure Jenkins with AWS CLI/SDK or IAM credentials (via credentials plugin). I install plugins like AWS EC2, use IAM roles (on EC2 agents), and store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager or Jenkins credentials.

#### 171Q. How many VPCs can you create per region?
Answer:
By default, you can create 5 VPCs per region per AWS account. This limit can be increased by requesting a quota increase from AWS.

#### 172Q. What is the difference between a private and public subnet?
Answer:
•	Public Subnet: A subnet that is associated with a route table that has a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW). Resources in this subnet can access the internet.
•	Private Subnet: A subnet that does not have a route to the Internet Gateway. Used for internal resources like databases.

#### 173Q. What is a Transit Gateway?
Answer:
An AWS Transit Gateway enables you to connect multiple VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub, simplifying your network architecture and reducing the number of peering connections.

#### 174Q. What is VPC Peering?
Answer:
VPC Peering allows direct communication between two VPCs in the same or different AWS accounts/regions. It’s non-transitive and is used for point-to-point connectivity.

#### 175Q. What is a VPC Endpoint?
Answer:
A VPC Endpoint allows private connection between your VPC and AWS services (like S3, DynamoDB) without using the internet, improving security and performance.

#### 176Q. How can you restore an RDS snapshot with a custom database name?
Answer:
You cannot directly rename a database when restoring a snapshot. Instead:
